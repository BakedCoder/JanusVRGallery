This is a very simple gallery script, that tries to imitate the behavior of the native imgur translation of JanusVR.
### How to use

Just place your pics into the ./Pictures Folder or feed the $picture[] array with any URLs. You might want to be carefull, what files you put into ./Pictures because this script doesn't check the files for being a picture.
